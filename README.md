# GPMT
The project aims to build a plug and play black-box adversarial attack model in the field of network traffic. 

It can generate practical variant malicious traffic with little knowledge of the target detection model.

The project consists of several modules.

Detection Model: containing a variety of malicious traffic detection models based on machine learning.

GPMT Framework: a novel anti-attack method, is used to generate real variant malicious traffic.
